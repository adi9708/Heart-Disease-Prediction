A heart attack (Cardiovascular diseases) occurs when the flow of blood to the heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked. 
From WHO statistics every year 17.9 million dying from heart attack. The medical study says that human life style is the main reason behind this heart problem. 
Apart from this there are many key factors which warns that the person may/maynot getting chance of heart attack.


The project successfully implemented and compared three machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine, for 
efficient prediction of cardiovascular disease.

Among the three classification techniques, Support Vector Machine demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest accuracy rate of 91.71%.

The utilization of machine learning algorithms allowed us to analyze and interpret various risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, enabling more accurate predictions
and personalized assessments.

The results obtained highlight the potential of the Support Vector Machine as a powerful tool for cardiovascular disease prediction, showcasing its effectiveness in real-world
applications.
